# Webhooks

## Headers

Each webhook from us will include these HTTP headers:

Name | Value | Description
---- | ----- | -----------
Accept | application/json
Content-Type | application/json
X-Event-Name | one of: healthcheck, product_updates | Name of the event
X-Event-Merchant | *UUID* | ID of your merchant (see **My Merchants**)
X-Event-Secret | *string, 64 chars, alphanumeric* | Webhook Secret (see **Setup**)

## Requirements

You must provide us a HTTPS webhook url that accepts POST requests and responds with 200 or 204 status code. If your server does not respond with 200/204 status code, we will try once again after 30 seconds and finally discard the event if the request failed again.

## Setup

To setup webhooks, go to **My Merchants** and click on <%= image_tag "images/webhooks-btn.jpg" %> in the **Actions** column. There is a **webhook secret**, which will be included in every webhook from us for verification, and a **webhook url**, which points to a URL on your server that processes our webhooks.

We recommend to frequently regenerate the **Webhook Secret**.
